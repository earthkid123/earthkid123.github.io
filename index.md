Hello! and welcome to my Github website. I currently possess a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from the State University of New York at New Paltz. In the near future I plan to pursue a Master's degree while working as an Instructional Support Technician for the Department of Security Systems & Law Enforcement Technology at Farmingdale State College. This website is going to contain a collection of tutorials I have written (this can be found in the tutorials tab), some projects I have been working on (found in the projects tab), notes from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) and reviews from MOOCS I have taken (this can be found in the blog tab).
