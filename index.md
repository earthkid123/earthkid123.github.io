Hello! and welcome to my Github website. I currently possess a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from the State University of New York at New Paltz. I also attend Georgia Institute of Technology Online for a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity (Concentration of Information Security) while working as an Instructional Support Technician for the Department of Security Systems & Computer Security Technology at Farmingdale State College. I now also am a Graduate Assistant online for CS 6035 (Introduction to Information Security).
