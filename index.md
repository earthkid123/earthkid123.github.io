Hello My name is Joseph Abel and welcome to Github website. I currently possess a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the State University of New York at New Paltz. In the near future I plan to pursue a Maser's degree while working as an Instructional Support Technician for the department of Security Systems & Law Enforcement Technology at Farmingdale State College. This website is going to contain a collection of tutorials I have written, some projects I have been working on, notes from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) and reviews from MOOCS I have taken.
