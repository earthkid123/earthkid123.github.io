Hello! and welcome to my Github website. I currently possess a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from the State University of New York at New Paltz. I also attend Georgia Institute of Technology Online for a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity (Concentration of Information Security) while working as an Instructional Support Technician for the Department of Security Systems & Computer Security Technology at Farmingdale State College. I know also am a Teacher Assistant onlien for CS 6035 (Introduction to Information Security). This website is going to contain a collection of tutorials I have written (this can be found in the tutorials tab), some projects I have been working on (found in the projects tab), notes from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) and reviews from MOOCS I have taken (this can be found in the blog tab).
