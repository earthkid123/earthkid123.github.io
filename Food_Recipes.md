<b> I really enjoy cooking. It is one of my favorite past times alongside baking. But besides baking cookies and brownies from scratch there isn't a whole lot else to me baking wise. But cooking wise I am much more adventurous... well to a degree at least. Below are a list of recipes which i feel confident in sharing. </b>

Pizza<br />
1.) Gather supplies such as your favorite sauce and cheese. I chose Rao Marinara and Organic Valley Mozzarella cheese. Next, gather your favorite crust:  Boboli, alternative pita brand or it could be a Sicilian pizza crust, like Brooklyn Bred.<br />
2.) You can skip this step if you don't like your pizza extra crispy/crunchy. However, if you like extra crispy pizza like me read this step, take your favorite olive oil, brush it on the pizza and then warm the bread at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes. This will make the bread softer to allow for optimal crispiness.<br />
3.) Add your favorite sauce to each pizza crust using a spoon. Sprinkle your favorite cheese over one or both pizzas as well. <br />
4.) Put it in the oven for 8 minutes on 400 degrees or until cheese is melted and edges are turning brown. Take out of the oven let it cool for a minute or two.<br />
5.) Take a pizza cutter and dig into your yummy pizza!<br />

Semi healthy Chicken Parmesian(Note: I usually have 6 chicken cutlets which equals out to 12 pieces for 5 people.  <br />
1.) First we need to gather our chicken cutlets i usually enjoy thick pieces so i slice them in half vertically but could be done via horizontal for thin pieces.  Once your piece of chicken is cut then you need to crack open some eggs and put them in a bowl i think 2 should be good. use a fork and whisk the eggs into a mixture which is densley yellow and you can't see the yolk.<br />

2.) Once that is done put your piece of chicken in a yolk and while it is sitting gather your bread crumbs on a plate use your favorite kind. I enjoy using plain because then i can put in my own spices like red chilli flakes, garlic powder, oregano, zesty lemon and italian seasoning. I mix that mixture up and then put the current piece of chicken in the egg plate to the bread crumbs and make sure you get it really covered the bread crumbs and then repeat this process for the rest of the chicken. Once each piece of chicken is done feel free to put them in a tin or cooking dish. We are going to bake the chicken yep it's going to be semi healthy! <br />

3.) Once you finished egging and breading your chicken and putting in your tin for my oven i need to let the chicken cook on 400 degrees for 40 minutes on one side then after that the other side for 20 minutes this could vary upon oven to oven and how thick your pieces are so keep an eye on the oven! <br />

4.) Once the chicken is cooked through the middle and is baked to perfection. Then add in the sauce and cheese. This is the tricky part if you keep the cheese on the chicken too long and it gets brown then it will taste strong the mozzarella almost like a smoked mozzarella but if you get it just right when it is slightly turning color it won't taste like that. I personally prefer mozzarella slices but shredded mozzarella is much more fun! <br />

5.) Let it bake again on 400 degrees for about 6-8 minutes or until cheese is fully melted or slightly turning color. <br />

6.) Sides: Boil some pasta put in some water to match the amount of pasta you will be cooking with as per the instructions on the box of pasta. I enjoy penne pasta with my chicken parm.... Then lastly garlic bread take a regular loaf of bread cut it in half horizontally so you have two pieces the left and right side of the bread put butter and garlic salt on each side of the bread... If you want feel free to melt the butter first then put it on and then sprinkle garlic salt on it. Wrap it up in aluminum foil after and put it in the oven with the chicken parm or after it for about 9 minutes on 400 degrees fahrenheit. <br />
