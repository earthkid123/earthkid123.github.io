<b> I really enjoy cooking. It is one of my favorite past times alongside baking. But besides baking cookies and brownies from scratch there isn't a whole lot else to me baking wise. But cooking wise I am much more adventurous... well to a degree at least. Below are a list of recipes which i feel confident in sharing. </b>

Pizza
1.) Gather supplies such as your favorite sauce and cheese. I chose Rao Marinara and Organic Valley Mozzarella cheese. Next, gather your favorite crust:  Boboli, alternative pita brand or it could be a Sicilian pizza crust, like Brooklyn Bred.<br />
2.) You can skip this step if you don't like your pizza extra crispy/crunchy. However, if you like extra crispy pizza like me read this step, take your favorite olive oil, brush it on the pizza and then warm the bread at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes. This will make the bread softer to allow for optimal crispiness.<br />
3.) Add your favorite sauce to each pizza crust using a spoon. Sprinkle your favorite cheese over one or both pizzas as well. <br />
4.) Put it in the oven for 8 minutes on 400 degrees or until cheese is melted and edges are turning brown. Take out of the oven let it cool for a minute or two.<br />
5.) Take a pizza cutter and dig into your yummy pizza!<br />
