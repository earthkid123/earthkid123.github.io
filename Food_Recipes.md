<b> I really enjoy cooking. It is one of my favorite past times alongside baking. But besides baking cookies and brownies from scratch there isn't a whole lot else to me baking wise. But cooking wise I am much more adventurous... well to a degree at least. Below are a list of recipes which i feel confident in sharing. </b>

**Pizza** <br />
1.) Gather supplies such as your favorite sauce and cheese. I chose Rao Marinara and Organic Valley Mozzarella cheese. Next, gather your favorite crust:  Boboli, alternative pita brand or it could be a Sicilian pizza crust, like Brooklyn Bred.<br />
2.) You can skip this step if you don't like your pizza extra crispy/crunchy. However, if you like extra crispy pizza like me read this step, take your favorite olive oil, brush it on the pizza and then warm the bread at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes. This will make the bread softer to allow for optimal crispiness.<br />
3.) Add your favorite sauce to each pizza crust using a spoon. Sprinkle your favorite cheese over one or both pizzas as well. <br />
4.) Put it in the oven for 8 minutes on 400 degrees or until cheese is melted and edges are turning brown. Take out of the oven let it cool for a minute or two.<br />
5.) Take a pizza cutter and dig into your yummy pizza!<br />

**Semi healthy Chicken Parmesian**(Note: I usually have 6 chicken cutlets which equals out to 12 pieces for 5 people. This is because I cut them in half)  <br />
1.) First we need to gather our chicken cutlets i usually enjoy thick pieces so i slice them in half vertically but could be done via horizontal for thin pieces.  Once your piece of chicken is cut then you need to crack open some eggs and put them in a bowl i think 2 should be good. use a fork and whisk the eggs into a mixture which is densley yellow and you can't see the yolk.<br />

2.) Once that is done put your piece of chicken in a yolk and while it is sitting gather your bread crumbs on a plate use your favorite kind. I enjoy using plain because then i can put in my own spices like red chilli flakes, garlic powder, oregano, zesty lemon and italian seasoning. I mix that mixture up and then put the current piece of chicken in the egg plate to the bread crumbs and make sure you get it really covered the bread crumbs and then repeat this process for the rest of the chicken. Once each piece of chicken is done feel free to put them in a tin or cooking dish. We are going to bake the chicken yep it's going to be semi healthy! <br />

3.) Once you finished egging and breading your chicken and putting in your tin for my oven i need to let the chicken cook on 400 degrees for 40 minutes on one side then after that the other side for 20 minutes this could vary upon oven to oven and how thick your pieces are so keep an eye on the oven! <br />

4.) Once the chicken is cooked through the middle and is baked to perfection. Then add in the sauce and cheese. This is the tricky part if you keep the cheese on the chicken too long and it gets brown then it will taste strong the mozzarella almost like a smoked mozzarella but if you get it just right when it is slightly turning color it won't taste like that. I personally prefer mozzarella slices but shredded mozzarella is much more fun! <br />

5.) Let it bake again on 400 degrees for about 6-8 minutes or until cheese is fully melted or slightly turning color. <br />

6.) Sides: Boil some pasta put in some water to match the amount of pasta you will be cooking with as per the instructions on the box of pasta. I enjoy penne pasta with my chicken parm.... Then lastly garlic bread take a regular loaf of bread cut it in half horizontally so you have two pieces the left and right side of the bread put butter and garlic salt on each side of the bread... If you want feel free to melt the butter first then put it on and then sprinkle garlic salt on it. Wrap it up in aluminum foil after and put it in the oven with the chicken parm or after it for about 9 minutes on 400 degrees fahrenheit. <br />

**Hibachi style Chicken and Steak with Fried Rice** <br />
1.) This is up for debate how one goes about this but you could use day old white or brown rice or you can cook it fresh the day of and let it set follow the rice recipe on the back of your rice for more information. Once your rice is cooked let it sit for an hour and get ready to prepare the other ingridents <br />

2.) Cook the chicken in a large deep skillet dish but down toasted seasme oil in the pan it has a nice coffee smell and then let it heat up. Once that is heating up take your chicken cutlet out do what you like with it deveining it or what not. Then take your cutting board and slice the pieces into one inch cubes and toss them inside the skillet you may have to use two if you are cooking a lot of chicken add salt and pepper to flavor or Teriyaki sauce for flavor. While this is cooking until golden brown check on the rice and stir around a little more to make sure its not still wet. <br />

3.) After the chicken is done or while its cooking how ever you would like prepare to cook some vegetables in another skillet prepare different veggies such as peats, carrots, peppers and cook with seasme oil again until throughly cooked and soft <br />

4.) Once those are down I use toasted seasme oil again (ha! I really like it) I crack about 4 eggs in a bowl whisk them together and put them in a small-medium skillet once the egg is cooked on both side I take the spatula and cut it up in the pan usually and have a slightly scramble structure but nice sized chunks for the egg (feel free to season it with truffle, parsley or salt and pepper) <br />

5.) Once all these ingredients are cooked move them all in a deep wok (Deep wok: A wok that just has a lot of space to hold food). Transfer the rice first and then the rest of the ingridents in no particular order unless you want one at the top first i usually do it so chicken is at the top. Once this is done I usually some soy sauce on a little bit of  the food it but mainly teriyaki sauce and then i constantly mix up the dish in the wok while pouring teriyaki sauce to cover most of the food ( I don't have an exact measurement here I apologize). <br />

6.) Once that is done I let it sit for an hour or so too cook and stir every 10 minutes the food to make sure it doesnt burn on a medium to high heat (for my stove at least). <br />

7. Serve after the hour or leave it on low until you serve. This dish goes well I hear with Riesling as per my fiancee. <br />

**Fudge Brownies** <br />

I don't have a step by step here because I got this from a Tasty video but when I make brownies for a party or in general for fun this is recipe I use it is easily the best and the brownies are always a hit the link is here:[Fudgy Brownies](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-fudgy-brownies) <br />
