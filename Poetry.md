I figured I should also have a collection of some of my poetry here since I enjoy it on my spare time below is a collection of some of my work. 

**Poem 1 Teardrop** <br />
Every teardrop <br />
Tear drops fall from your blue eyes   <br />
my heart skips a beat at their sight  <br />
I pull you close to me   <br />
try to take the pain from you <br />
make it my own  <br />
My cheek lays against yours  <br />
laying down stepping stones  <br />
upon your tears that burn my face  <br />
as I whisper  <br />
Darling it will be all right.  <br />
My tears blend with your own  <br />
your pain now mine  <br />
and our tears become one  <br />
as they fall into banks of flowing water with pebbles.  <br />
Pebbles that don't sink they float  <br />
Then we look face to face   <br />
Who we are is this what we've become  <br />
Become who the people that exist  <br />
The people that exist when time freezes  <br />
A look upon your face  <br />
I dry your tears with kisses  <br />
soft upon your face  <br />
shelter you from pain  <br />
in the recesses of my love.  <br />
  <br />
**Poem 2 Shall we Dance**   <br />
A girl gracefully moving across the stage   <br />
She stops her eyes close   <br />
She hears a voice “Shall we dance my lady?”  <br />
She slowly opens her eyes and sees no one   <br />
She closes her eyes again   <br />
and hears the same voice saying “shall we dance my lady?”  <br />
Without hesitant she opens her eyes   <br />
immediately and sees a figure in the shadow.   <br />
She approaches the shadow   <br />
but then ponders a thought what if this   <br />
is a fancy?   <br />
She continues moving now   <br />
with a glimer of light in her eyes.  <br />
The figure standing up straight   <br />
looks at the girl and is turned   <br />
to stone as there is no other beauty  <br />
so beautiful then that of her  <br />
The figure goes up to her and says   <br />
“Shall we dance my lady?”  <br />
  <br />
**Poem 3 Life**  <br />
Where Life Takes You  <br />
In an instant  <br />
The question is gone  <br />
Choices made  <br />
One action begets another  <br />
No turning back  <br />
We move in time  <br />
Lead by forces unseen  <br />
We pass each other  <br />
Perhaps only briefly  <br />
Perhaps for longer  <br />
Tiny acts of kindness  <br />
Heartfelt words  <br />
A hand reaches out  <br />
Grabs the heart  <br />
Expectation of the harsh  <br />
Receiving gentle strokes of caring  <br />
Words of wisdom shared  <br />
Hugs sent along  <br />
Unknown prayers answered  <br />
Gratitude and friendship  <br />
The depths of which remain untold  <br />
Yet moved to tears of thanks  <br />
Friends for an instant  <br />
Marks the soul eternally  <br />
Never to be forgotten  <br />
Only to be cherished  <br />
for Always  <br />
  <br />
**Poem 4 Cage**  <br />
Captured in a cage I am a slave,  <br />
But Whom do I work for?  <br />
The bars they are closing in... <br />
This cage is tight; I cant breathe   <br />
But not being free is what hurts more  <br />
In this world I am a dime   <br />
compared to the penny and nickel   <br />
I'm smaller but worth more   <br />
They shout they yell “Hey Man!”... No response  <br />
But I'm free for only a second... nothing  <br />
Like the squeeze of a spray can   <br />
I keep stumbling but I wont trip   <br />
I'm locked in a room with no windows   <br />
And a door knob that won't twist   <br />
My feelings are locked there are things I just can't let out  <br />
Feeling like a baby in a crib and not being able to break  <br />
I grab the bars but free I can't have it I'm dying   <br />
This cage it..it... Feels like a casket   <br />
  <br />
**Poem 5 Fussion**  <br />
Floating quiety in the serene night sky  <br />
As the gleam of the stars reflect my tears   <br />
The vibration intensity rushes through   <br />
my bones which tell me this is a new   <br />
beginning.  <br />
Almost like a new perception of space and time   <br />
I feel the stepping stones of time and space   <br />
laid out just to guide me on the correct path   <br />
Time the change of a movement but space one with  <br />
an influence of making a certain place appear or change its features?   <br />
Does space fuse with time to form reality?  <br />
Each star has a different brightness in   <br />
the night sky to represent a reason   <br />
Do Scared Space and Eternal Time form reality?  <br />

**Poem 6 to come into the new year**
